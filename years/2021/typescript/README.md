# advent-of-code-2021

My participation in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/).

Please feel free to browse through my solutions. Be warned that there may be spoilers if you haven't submitted your own answers already.

## Edit/build/run/repeat

Most of the code other than the solutions is from [advent-of-code](https://github.com/T-Hugs/advent-of-code) by [T-Hugs](https://github.com/T-Hugs).
I have retained his original readme file as `readme.T-Hugs.md`, but I'll try to copy the relevant bits into here.

## Acknowledgements

* A big thank you to `u/vulpine-linguist` on Reddit for showing me the way out of a hole I'd dug myself into
  on day 16 part 2.
